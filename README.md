# My Own Website

## üåê About Project
This is a personal website I built to showcase my skills in programming and also have a platform to demonstrate my knowledge. The website is built using Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. It serves as a space to display my projects, progress, resume, and provide ways to contact me.
I also made a tutorial on **how to build this website**, which you can watch on my YouTube channel.

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions [ That i experienced ]

### 1. Setting Up Flask Environment  
During the setup, I faced some challenges in creating the virtual environment for Flask. There were issues with ensuring the correct versions of dependencies were installed, and I needed to ensure Flask was running smoothly.

**Solution**:  
I had to manually install the necessary dependencies and double-check that I was using compatible versions. I also made sure the environment variables were set correctly to avoid conflicts.

### 2. Conflicts with PythonAnywhere Dependency Versions  
While uploading the project to **PythonAnywhere**, I encountered issues with version conflicts between the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Some packages did not match the expected versions.

**Solution**:  
To resolve this, I manually updated the versions of the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file to match the ones that worked with PythonAnywhere. After updating the versions, I successfully deployed the app.

### 3. Using ChatGPT for Clean Code and Faster Progress  
To make the development process faster and ensure clean code, I leveraged ChatGPT for coding assistance. It helped me with optimizing some functions, providing guidance on best practices, and troubleshooting tricky issues.

**Solution**:  
Using ChatGPT as a resource helped me significantly reduce time spent on coding, allowing me to focus more on the project as a whole. ChatGPT's suggestions were invaluable in refining my code and ensuring it adhered to best practices.
